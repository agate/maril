# Maril

Maril is abbreviation of "Marathon Application Run In Local". Which is a command line interface to generate `docker run` command from a marathon application configuration.

## Installation

Open your terminal and execute:

```
$ gem install maril
```

I also provide a greasemonkey userscript. It will add a button on your marathon application page. You just need to click it and the `docker run` command will be saved into your clipboard.

You can click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agate/maril/master/userscript/maril.user.js) to install it.

> Remember: You have to either change `@match` or add new `@match` in this userscript to match your marathon site. So that this button can show up.

## Usage

Open your terminal and run:

```
$ maril --host http://your.marathon.domain --id /your/application/id
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Release

```
$ rake build
$ rake release
```
